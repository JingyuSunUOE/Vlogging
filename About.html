        <h2>Vlogging - Student Community of University of Edinburgh</h2>
        <p>
            We are an association of the University of Edinburgh, and most of the members are made up of our students.<br />
            <br />
            We also welcome non-student members to join us if you have the same interests as us.<br />
            <br />
            We have different shooting themes every month, you can use your creativity under these themes, and there are no restrictions on shooting methods.<br />
            <br />
            Although we are not a professional photography team, but we have a wealth of experience, you can get any help you want here.<br />
            <br />
            Our community also provides some shooting equipment, including microphones, microphones and spotlights.<br />
            <br />
            All the videos taken will be uploaded to the club's media platform, and we will give appropriate rewards based on popularity.<br />
            <br />
            If you are only interested in our community and don't want to join us, please give us your opinion on the video we made.<br />
            <br />
            We look forward to anyone joining.<br />
